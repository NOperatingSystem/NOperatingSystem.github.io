### Welcome to the NoOS (N Operating System) website!
Here you'll find all of the information you'll need.

### Build Status:
![CI](https://github.com/MoltenCoreDev/noOS/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

### Projects
These are the projects that we are currently working on:
1. The N Operating System (NoOS)
2. NoOS for ARM
3. This website
4. Dripman, packages that you can import in NoOS

### [Wiki](https://github.com/NOperatingSystem/NOperatingSystem/wiki)
The wiki has info about the built-in commands, features, and more. That should be the main place for help.

### Supported Architectures
We currently only support the NASM x86 real-mode instruction set, if you know how to use protected 32-bit mode, ARM asm, or something else, reach out to us through [Issues](https://github.com/NOperatingSystem/NOperatingSystem/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/NOperatingSystem/NOperatingSystem/discussions) so you can help and contribute.
